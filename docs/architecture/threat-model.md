# Threat Model: Swedish Association Voting Contract

## External Dependencies

| Dependency                          | Purpose                     | Failure Impact             | Mitigation Strategy                          |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Off-chain Member Verification**   | Verify member eligibility   | Fake members could vote    | Legal accountability + on-chain verification |
| **Off-chain Result Processing**     | Calculate final results     | Incorrect results recorded | Hash verification + audit trail              |
| **Meta-transaction Infrastructure** | Gas sponsorship for members | Members can't vote         | Fallback: direct gas payment                 |
| **Blockchain Network**              | Transaction processing      | Voting unavailable         | Monitor network status                       |

## Upgradeability Decision

**Upgradeable**: **NO**
**Rationale**:

- Voting integrity requires immutability
- Swedish associations need predictable governance
- Simplicity reduces attack surface
- Legal compliance requires stable contracts

**If No - Limitations**:

- Cannot add new features after deployment
- Cannot fix bugs (mitigated by thorough testing)
- Cannot change voting logic

## Trust Assumptions

**Users must trust**:

- Organization admin (legal entity)
- Off-chain member verification process
- Off-chain result calculation accuracy
- Meta-transaction infrastructure (if used)

**Single points of failure**:

- Organization admin address
- Off-chain member verification
- Off-chain result processing

**Governance requirements**:

- No DAO integration needed
- Legal governance through Swedish association structure

## Dependency Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Off-chain Member Verification**: If compromised, fake members could vote
- **Off-chain Result Processing**: If compromised, incorrect results could be recorded

### Medium Risk

- **Meta-transaction Infrastructure**: If fails, members can't vote (but can pay gas directly)
- **Organization Admin**: Single point of failure (mitigated by legal accountability)

### Low Risk

- **Blockchain Network**: Standard infrastructure risk
- **UI/UX Applications**: Can be rebuilt if needed

## Attack Vectors & Mitigations

### 1. Member Impersonation

**Attack**: Fake member registration
**Mitigation**: Off-chain verification + legal accountability
**Risk Level**: High

### 2. Vote Manipulation

**Attack**: Unauthorized vote casting
**Mitigation**: Member verification + one vote per member
**Risk Level**: High

### 3. Result Tampering

**Attack**: Manipulation of final results
**Mitigation**: Hash verification + audit trail
**Risk Level**: High

### 4. Session Hijacking

**Attack**: Unauthorized session creation/modification
**Mitigation**: Admin-only functions + immutable admin
**Risk Level**: Medium

### 5. Gas Griefing

**Attack**: Malicious gas consumption
**Mitigation**: Organization pays gas + batch operations
**Risk Level**: Medium

### 6. Privacy Violations

**Attack**: Unauthorized access to private votes
**Mitigation**: Configurable privacy settings + access controls
**Risk Level**: Medium

### 7. Timing Attacks

**Attack**: Manipulation of voting deadlines
**Mitigation**: Immutable session parameters + pause functionality
**Risk Level**: Low

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

1. **Access Control**: Admin-only functions
2. **Member Verification**: Off-chain + on-chain validation
3. **Vote Integrity**: One vote per member, non-transferable
4. **Result Immutability**: Hash-based verification
5. **Emergency Controls**: Pause functionality

### Failure Mode Analysis

- **Admin Compromise**: Legal accountability + immutable admin
- **Member Verification Failure**: Legal recourse + audit trail
- **Result Processing Error**: Hash verification + dispute resolution
- **Network Issues**: Monitoring + alternative voting methods

### Monitoring & Alerting

- **Admin Action Monitoring**: All admin functions logged
- **Vote Pattern Analysis**: Detect unusual voting patterns
- **Session Status Tracking**: Monitor active/paused sessions
- **Gas Usage Monitoring**: Track organization gas costs
