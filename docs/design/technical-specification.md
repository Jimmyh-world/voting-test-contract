# Technical Specification: Swedish Association Voting Contract

## Core Purpose

**Problem Statement**: Enable secure, transparent voting for Swedish association (förening) governance processes including Annual General Meetings and Special Meetings.

**Target Users**:

1. Organization (Board of Directors/Secretary) - Sets agenda and issues for voting
2. Association Members - Cast votes on each issue

**Scope Boundaries**:

- Does NOT alter anything on-chain (balances, etc.)
- Records only the final result hash on-chain
- All other data remains off-chain

**MVP Definition**:

- Simple yes/no/abstain voting on individual questions
- Organization can create voting sessions
- Members can cast votes
- Final results recorded as hash on-chain

**Standards Compatibility**:

- No specific ERC standards identified yet
- Will research relevant governance standards and libraries

## KISS Validation

- [x] Purpose fits in one sentence
- [x] User types ≤ 5 (only 2 identified)
- [x] Clear boundaries defined
- [x] MVP identified

## Detailed Requirements

### Voting Session Management

- **Duration**: 1-1.5 hours per session
- **Quorum**: Not required in initial contract (can be added later)
- **Pause Functionality**: Sessions can be paused under extenuating circumstances only
- **Multiple Questions**: Yes, multiple questions per session
- **Voting Requirement**: Members must vote on all questions (can abstain)

### Member Authentication

- **Method**: Off-chain verification with on-chain designator (wallet address or non-transferable NFT)
- **Registration**: Off-chain first, then pushed on-chain
- **Management**: Member registration handled off-chain

### Vote Privacy

- **Default**: Votes are visible during voting
- **Configuration**: Privacy settings are selectable per issue (on/off toggle)
- **Flexibility**: Organization can choose visibility per question

### Result Verification

- **Method**: Simple "idiot-proof" off-chain process
- **On-chain**: Only final result hash recorded
- **Verification**: Members can verify hash matches actual results

### Gas Optimization

- **Payment**: Organization pays all gas costs
- **Requirement**: Gas optimization is mandatory
- **Strategy**: Batch operations and efficient storage patterns

## Economic Model

**Value Creation**:

- Transparent, immutable voting records for Swedish associations
- Reduced administrative overhead for governance processes
- Enhanced trust through blockchain-based verification

**Fee Structure**:

- Organization pays all gas costs
- No fees for members (gas sponsored)
- No revenue generation (non-profit governance tool)

**User Incentives**:

- Members: Transparent voting process, verifiable results
- Organization: Reduced administrative burden, legal compliance
- No financial incentives (prevents gaming)

**Sustainability Plan**:

- One-time deployment cost
- Ongoing gas costs borne by organization
- No recurring fees or tokenomics

**Token Economics**:

- No tokens involved
- Pure governance utility

## Economic Risks

**Fee optimization attacks**:

- Minimal (organization controls gas costs)
- Batch operations reduce gas impact

**Economic exploits**:

- No financial value to extract
- Reputational risk only

**Sustainability concerns**:

- Low ongoing costs (gas only)
- Organization commitment required
